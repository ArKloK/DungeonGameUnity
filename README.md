<h1>⚔️ 2D Top-Down Dungeon Game ⚔️</h1>

<h2>📄 Description</h2>

This Zelda-like game is my very first project created in Unity. It is a simple adaptation of 2D Zelda games, featuring a top-down view. The game has 2 scenes:

The first scene is a very simple and quick tutorial with an enemy.

The second scene is where a few enemies try to kill the player. There are also some breakable objects around the map that can drop items.

<h2>🏁 Goal</h2>

The goal of the game is to complete it as fast as you can, and each attempt will be recorded on a scoreboard with the time spent completing the game.
